## About the Project:
ESP32-WROOM (XTENSA) based “smart” power strip. Device connects to WiFi network and provides a webserver interface from which connected devices can be turned on or off. Power input directly from mains (120V @ 60 Hz). Incorporates the use of solid state [opto-isolated] relays to safely toggle power on and off. Proof of concept demonstration for moderate power and current applications on silver nano-particle inkjet PCBs.

## What I Primarily Worked On:
Designed the schematic, PCB design, and then fabricated the circuit. Programmed the processor using Arduino IDE (C++). Thoroughly documented creation of the device. Assembled and built device based on developed schematics.
